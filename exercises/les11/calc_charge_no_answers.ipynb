    "The charge of a protein is dependent on the pH. All proteins contain a N-terminus and a C-terminus that can be protonated or deprotonated, depending on the pH. In addition, some amino acids have side chains that can be protonated or deprotonated. As a result, the net charge of the protein will depend on the pH. The pKa of the N-terminal amino group is approximately 9.5. That means that below a pH of 9.5, the amino group will have a charge of +1 and above this pH, the amino group will have a charge of 0. The pKa of the C-terminal carboxyl group is approximately 2.3. That means that above a pH of 2.3, the carboxyl group will have a charge of -1 and below the pH of 2.3, the carboxyl group will have a charge of 0.\n",

    "As mentioned above, some side chains of amino acids can be protonated/deprotonated dependent on the pH. We call these side chains [ionizable](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/10990979/ionizable-amino-acids-protonated-deprotonated-forms-).  \n",
    "They can be devided in two types. \n",
    "- Amino acids with side chains that can aquire a **negative charge**: Aspartic Acid (D), Glutamic Acid (E), Cysteine (C),  Tyrosine (Y). If the pH is **above** the pKa value of the side chain, the amino acid will have a -1 charge. Else the charge will be 0.\n",
    "- Amino acids with side chains that can aquire a **positive charge**: Lysine (K), Arginine(R), Histidine (H). If the pH is **below** the pKa value of the side chain, the amino acid will have a +1 charge. Else the charge will be 0.\n",
